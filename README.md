# Advent of Code 2020

Increasingly hacky solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Mostly done in Python in an Jupyter notebook and then marginally cleaned up afterward. There's a
strong emphasis on getting a solution as fast as possible i.e. with minimal input validation,
unit tests, etc. ðŸš¢

## Running

### Python 2/3

Grab input text file from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) and pass it an argument to
each day's solution script. For example, to run day 1:

```sh
day1/p1.py <path to input file>
```
