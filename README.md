# Advent of Code 2020

Increasingly hacky solutions to the 2020 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Mostly done in Python in an Jupyter notebook and then marginally cleaned up afterward. There's a
strong emphasis on getting a solution as fast as possible i.e. with minimal input validation,
unit tests, etc. ðŸš¢

## Running

### Python

Pass input file as an argument to each day's solution script. For example, to run day 1:

```sh
day1/p1.py day1/input.txt
```
